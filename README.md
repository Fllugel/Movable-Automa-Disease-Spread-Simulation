# Movable Cellular Automaton for Disease Spread Prediction

This project is a simulation of a movable cellular automaton designed to predict disease spread. The cells can move randomly, collide with each other, and some cells can be infected, allowing for interaction between infected and non-infected cells.

## Features

- Cells move randomly in a 2D space.
- Infected cells can infect other cells upon collision.
- Cells bounce off the walls and each other.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This project is built using Python and Pygame.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (or download the zip file) to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fllugel/Movable-Automa-Disease-Spread-Simulation
   cd repository-name

2. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
